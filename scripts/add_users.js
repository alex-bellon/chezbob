/*
    The add_users script reads a list of emails (one per line) from stdin
    and creates users for all of them.

    Common usage:   cat new_user.txt | node scripts/add_users.js


    The usernames of the generated users are pulled from the email:
        
        foo@email.com

    results in:

        | username |        foo       |
        -------------------------------
        |    foo   |  foo@email.com   |

    If the username or email exists, the conflict will be printed to stderr
